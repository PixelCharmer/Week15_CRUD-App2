## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/PixelCharmer/Week15_CRUD-App2/assets/145899504/dbe0315f-47a1-4be7-96ce-4e362294a0c2)

This is a simple Candidate Tracker web application built using React. The app allows users to track and manage candidates for various positions. It includes features such as adding new candidates, updating candidate information, and deleting candidates.

### Technologies Used
React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

MockAPI: Candidate data is fetched and managed through a mock API. This API is used to simulate backend functionality for storing and retrieving candidate information.

React Bootstrap: The application's UI components, including tables and buttons, are styled using the React Bootstrap library.

### Features
##### Candidate Table
The main component of the app is the Candidate Table, which displays candidate information in a tabular format. The table includes columns for Candidate Name, Job Title, Candidate Status, and options to Update or Delete a candidate.

##### Add Candidate Form
Users can add new candidates by filling out the Add Candidate Form. The form captures necessary details such as Candidate Name, Job Title, and Candidate Status. Upon submission, the new candidate is added to the list.

##### Update Candidate
Candidates can be updated by clicking the "Update" button in the table, which opens a form with pre-filled information. Users can modify the details and submit the changes, updating the candidate information.

##### Delete Candidate
Candidates can be removed from the list by clicking the "Delete" button. This action is irreversible, and it permanently removes the selected candidate.
